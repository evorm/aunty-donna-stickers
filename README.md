aunty donna stickers for whatsapp


It's specifically for WhatsApp. If you do use WhatsApp and you want the pack you'd need the https://stickermakerapp.xyz app
(site has links to the play store and app store, but the file is a .wastickers file which should work with most WhatsApp sticker
apps but that's the one I used and confirm works) to be able to add it since I don't have an app of my own. I'll host the file
online in a bit for those that want it, but I don't know how you'd go about downloading it on Apple devices since I haven't
used one in years and I don't know if they still have the option to download files from the internet. Once both the app and
the stickerpack file are downloaded it should just open the file with the app automatically and you can just add it to WhatsApp from there.
